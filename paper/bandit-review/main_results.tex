\section{Overview of main results}

\subsection{Total variation}
In this section we go into the algorithms and techniques used in \citep{hazan}
in more detail to explore how they managed to bound regret by total variation in the
adversarial bandit setting.

\subsubsection{Algorithms}
First we state the algorithm developed in \citep{hazan} in full, and walk through them
to analyze the choices that were made.
