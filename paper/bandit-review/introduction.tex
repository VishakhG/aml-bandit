\section{Introduction}

We review the papers by
\citep{alon, hazan, bertsimas} and describe the main ideas and connections. 

\textbf{Related Work:} 
The paper by 
\citep{alon} uses graphs to represent how much information an agent recieves about 
other actions after choosing to take an action at every round. 

\citep{hazan} describes a novel setting for non-stochastic bandits where bounds are given with respect to the total variation of a reward sequence. 

\citep{bertsimas} describes a series of LP-relaxations for approximately solving
the restless bandit problem.
